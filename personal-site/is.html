              <p class="lead">I know you've all seen important people, doing very important things even as infants, but I assure you, I'm just as clueless about the world as you are :) Right now, I'm <span style="color: #7EC4F1"><strong>20</strong></span>, still figuring out about the little things in life, like the age old question: <span style="color: #7EC4F1"><strong>IS WATER WET??</strong></span></p>

              <h2 class="featurette-heading">What I'm doing now</h2>
              <p class="lead">Apart from being a full-time student, I'm dipping my toes into web dev to see if any of these stuff peaks my interest. My mind is full of life, and I absolutely love anything that requires me using my creativity, such as building a project from scratch and watching it come together. Ok, but in all seriousness what I'm doing RIGHT NOW? ahh probably sitting on the couch scrolling through TikTok with my posture like a constipated shrimp <i>hehehe</i></p>

              <p class="lead">I won't bore you with all the details, but I'll just briefly take you through my educational journey, the little steps I took to get to where I am now.</p>
              <h3>Ai Tong School (2008 - 2013)</h3>
              <p class="lead">Primary school passed as a blur, and it was just 6 painful years of emily going with the flow~ It was fun, with all that remains in my memories being immature jokes and lots of laughter.</p>
              <h3>Anderson Secondary School (2014 - 2017)</h3>
              <h4>GCE O'level results: raw 6 points</h4>
              <p class="lead">Now, these comes one of the best years of my life thus far. Secondary school provided me with a close knit community, and I made lifelong friends through classes, and my CCA <span style="color: #7EC4F1"><strong>Girl Guides</strong></span>. Here, I grew the most as a hormonal imbalanced teenager.</p>
              <h3>Hwa Chong Institution (2018 - 2019)</h3>
              <h4>GCE A'level results: AAA/C</h4>
              <p class="lead">Leaving drama-attracting emily behind, now we step into Junior College. Though the 2 years were short and the stress immense, I quicky grew fond of the unique community of my college, as it was a space for high flyers and eager venturers. It was then, I started my own YFC project, <span style="color: #7EC4F1"><strong>Project Kinderact</strong></span>.</p>
              <h3>National University of Singapore (2020 - 2024)</h3>
              <p class="lead">After applying to Business Analytics in NUS, NUS has been an avenue for self-discovery and getting myself out of my comfort zone. Joining <span style="color: #7EC4F1"><strong>Start-IT Technopreneurship Society</strong></span> has further fuelled my passion to explore my interests and chase my dreams  </p>
