              <p class="lead">I am a total sucker for all things aesthetic, and so you can expect me to spend hours on illustrator putting together a new random poster, or zine. By no means am I a professional at what I do, but the joy of looking at a well designed piece of work is by far the best feeling ever.</p>
              <h2 class="featurette-heading">All things fooodd!<span>&nbsp;<img src="images/pancake.png" width="33" height="33"></span></h2>
              <p class="lead">O man.. sorry to have to put you through this, but well.. you signed up for this! I can't name you a favourite dish of mine. but if I were have to choose, it would either be xiao long bao, or a good hearty burger! My love of food have also led me to venture into baking, and you will be shocked by how good my sourdough is :)</p>
              <h2 class="featurette-heading">Journaling<span>&nbsp;<img src="images/pen.png" width="33" height="33"></span></h2>
              <p class="lead">Ever since I've realised the importance of journaling, I haven't stopped. Life is filled with so many moving parts, and if not acknowledged, its bound of get overwhelming. Heres a quote which has stuck by me for a while now: <br><span style="color: #FF95AB"><i>"if you can dance and be free and not be embarrassed, you can rule the world"</i> -Amy Poehler</span></p>
              <h2 class="featurette-heading">Travelling<span>&nbsp;<img src="images/travel.png" width="33" height="33"></span></h2>
              <p class="lead">Covid really put brakes on this one, but prior to the pandemic, the thrill and healing feeling of travelling made me fall in love with it! It's rare that we see such diversity and such fun that is close to non-existent in Singapore. If the situation allows for it, I would love to travel to Korea and Switzerland!</p>
              <h2 class="featurette-heading">And other random things...<span>&nbsp;<img src="images/camera.png" width="35" height="35"></span></h2>
              <p class="lead">My recent obsessions with film cameras and mechanical keyboards are certainly one of the many other interests I have currently... O have I mentioned how much I love embroidery? <i>hahaha</i> Everytime something catches my eye, I tend to be crazy obsessed with it, and would try to take it up as a hobby! ps... I love cycling tooo!</p>
